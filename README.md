# BLT — Hello World Starter

A minimal, branded landing page that respects existing BLT brand assets. No edits to the logo or mark—only placement and scaling.

## Files
- `index.html`
- Brand assets copied here if provided (e.g., `BLT.png`, `BLT.jpg`, `COVER-twitter.jpg`).

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repo.
2. Upload all files in this folder (use **Add file → Upload files**).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set Source to `Deploy from a branch` → `main` → `/ (root)`.
4. (Optional) Add a custom domain in Pages settings and point your DNS accordingly.

That's it—your BLT "Hello World" page will be live.
